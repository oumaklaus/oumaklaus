## 🧠 About Me

I’m a cybersecurity student focused on **cloud penetration testing**, with hands-on practice in identifying and exploiting **AWS misconfigurations**, **IAM privilege escalation paths**, and **real-world cloud weaknesses**.

I actively sharpen my skills through **CTFs**, **cloud labs**, and **security research**, while documenting my learning to build a strong offensive security foundation.
